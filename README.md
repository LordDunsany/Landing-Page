# Landing-Page


## Introduction: 
The goal is to create a simple styled landing page without any functional links, using flexbox.


### Preface: 
This is my attempt at creating a landing page as similar to the example-page as possible. I will solely use flexbox to achieve this, since it is something I need to practice. My current understanding of coding is rudimentary, but I aim to improve.

### Post:
I am content with the final layout of the page. Some solutions were unnecessary and perhaps to convoluted. My take away is that perhaps it is important to focus on the style of the code itself aswell and the readability. I think I managed this somewhat in the HTML, but for the CSS it was more difficult. I hope to keep improving as I go along with The Odin Project.
