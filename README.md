# Landing-Page


## Introduction: 
The goal is to create a simple styled landing page without any functional links, using HTML and CSS.


### Preface: 
This is my attempt at creating a landing page as similar to the example-page provided by TOP as possible. I will solely rely on flexbox to achieve this, beginning with a column layout. Hover effects will be added to buttons and links, but they will not be functional or interactive in any capacity.

### Post:
I am content with the final layout of the page. Some solutions were unnecessary and perhaps convoluted. My take away is that it is important to focus on the styling/layout of the code itself aswell as the readability. I think I managed this somewhat in the HTML, not only with the tabs but also with the comment sections. For the CSS I find it more difficult. Many things could probably be simplified. Perhaps use the parent elements more for creating the basic designs and then the children for specifying. I also used some media queries for scaling purposes.
